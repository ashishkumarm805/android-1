<h2>Beta testers</h2>

<p>You can also sign up as a beta-tester for our Android app, simply by opting into the beta programme in the Google Play Store. This enables you to get the latest improvements and give feedback before they are released officially.</p>
<p>The app is <a href="https://github.com/cyclestreets/android/">open source</a> and we very much welcome new contributions of code, bug reports, etc.</p>

	<li>Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and find the "Become a beta tester" box, and click on "I'm in".</li>
	<li>This will then show "Beta sign-up in progress&hellip;".</li>
	<li>After, when you click "Install" at the top of the page, that will install the beta app.</li>
